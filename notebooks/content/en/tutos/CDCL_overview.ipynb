    "The CD-CL framework is an adapation of the well-konw SAT [CDCL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning) to discrete constraint solver.\n",
    "By exploiting the implication graph (that records events, i.e. variables' modifications), this algorithm is able to derive a new constraint from the events that led to a contradiction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once added to the constraint network, this constraint makes possible to \"backjump\" (non-chronological backtrack) to the appropriate decision in the decision path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CP, learned constraints are denoted \"signed-clauses\" which is a disjunction of signed-literals, *i.e.* membership unary constraints : $\\bigvee_{i = 0}^{n} X_i \\in D_{i}$ where $X_i$ are variables and $D_i$ a set of values.\n",

    "### RCPSP\n",
    "The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a well-known optimization problem in project management. It involves scheduling a set of activities or tasks, each with a specific duration and resource requirements, while considering limited resources availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RCPSP, the goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal schedule that minimizes the project's duration or cost, while respecting resource constraints. These constraints typically include limitations on the availability of resources such as workers, machines, or materials. Activities cannot be scheduled simultaneously if they require the same resource, and the overall schedule must ensure that resource capacities are not exceeded at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem becomes more complex when considering dependencies between activities, where some activities must be completed before others can start. The objective is to create a feasible schedule that meets all constraints and completes the project as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an instance for 30 activities.\n",
    "Note that two dummy activities are added, a source (1) and a sink (32), for successors declaration.\n",
    "Neither of them consumes any resources."
